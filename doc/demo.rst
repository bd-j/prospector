Demonstrations
==============

You can check out the Jupyter notebook demo at the
`InteractiveDemo <https://github.com/bd-j/prospector/blob/main/demo/InteractiveDemo.ipynb>`_

Code used to make the fits and figures in the `prospector paper
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..254...22J/abstract>`_
is available in `this <https://github.com/bd-j/exspect>`_ github repository.


Interactive Figure
------------------

Also, below is an example of inference from an increasing number of photometric
bands. Model parameters and SEDs are inferred (in blue) from a changing number
of mock photometric bands (grey points). The mock is generated at the parameters
and with the SED marked in black.  This shows how with a small amount of data
most posteriors are determined by the prior (dotted green) but that as the
number of bands increases, the data are more infomative and the posterior
distributions are narrower than the prior.

Click the buttons show the inference for different filter sets:
