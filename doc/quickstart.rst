Quickstart
==========

Here's a quick intro that fits 5-band SDSS photometry with a simple delay-tau
parametric SFH model. This assumes you've successully installed prospector and
all the prerequisites.  This is intended simply to introduce the key
ingrediants; for more realistic usage see :ref:`demo` or the :ref:`tutorial`.

.. code:: python

    import fsps
    import dynesty
    import sedpy
    import h5py, astropy
    import numpy as np
    import astroquery


Build an observation
--------------------

First we'll get some data, using ``astroquery`` to get SDSS photometry of a
galaxy.  We'll also get spectral data so we know the redshift.

.. code:: python

    from astroquery.sdss import SDSS
    from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    bands = "ugriz"
    mcol = [f"cModelMag_{b}" for b in bands]
    ecol = [f"cModelMagErr_{b}" for b in bands]
    cat = SDSS.query_crossid(SkyCoord(ra=204.46376, dec=35.79883, unit="deg"),
                             data_release=16,
                             photoobj_fields=mcol + ecol + ["specObjID"])
    shdus = SDSS.get_spectra(plate=2101, mjd=53858, fiberID=220)[0]
    assert int(shdus[2].data["SpecObjID"][0]) == cat[0]["specObjID"]

Now we will put this data in the format expected by prospector. We convert the
magnitudes to maggies, convert the magnitude errors to flux uncertainties
(including a noise floor), and load the filter transmission curves using
`sedpy`. We'll store the redshift here as well for convenience.  Note that for
this example we do *not* attempt to fit the spectrum at the same time, though we
include an empty Spectrum data set to force a prediction of the full spectrum.

.. code:: python

    from sedpy.observate import load_filters
    from prospect.observation import Photometry, Spectrum

    filters = load_filters([f"sdss_{b}0" for b in bands])
    maggies = np.array([10**(-0.4 * cat[0][f"cModelMag_{b}"]) for b in bands])
    magerr = np.array([cat[0][f"cModelMagErr_{b}"] for b in bands])
    magerr = np.hypot(magerr, 0.05)

    pdat = Photometry(filters=filters, flux=maggies, uncertainty=magerr*maggies/1.086,
                      name=f'sdss_phot_specobjID{cat[0]["specObjID"]}')
    sdat = Spectrum(wavelength=None, flux=None, uncertainty=None)
    observations = [sdat, pdat]
    for obs in observations:
        obs.redshift = shdus[2].data[0]["z"]


In principle we could also add noise models for the spectral and photometric
data (e.g. to fit for the photometric noise floor), but we'll make the default
assumption of iid Gaussian noise for the moment.


Build a Model
-------------

Here we will get a default parameter set for a simple parametric SFH, and add a
set of parameters describing nebular emission.  We'll also fix the redshift to
the value given by SDSS. This model has 5 free parameters, each of which has an
associated prior distribution.  These default prior distributions can and should
be replaced or adjusted depending on your particular science question. Here
we'll just change the prior distribution for stellar mass, as an example.

.. code:: python

    # Get a baseline set of model parameters
    from prospect.models.templates import TemplateLibrary
    from prospect.models import SpecModel
    model_params = TemplateLibrary["parametric_sfh"]
    model_params.update(TemplateLibrary["nebular"])
    model_params["zred"]["init"] = obs["redshift"]

    # Adjust the prior for mass, giving a wider range
    from prospect.models import priors
    model_params["mass"]["prior"] = priors.LogUniform(mini=1e6, maxi=1e13)

    # Instantiate the model using this parameter dictionary
    model = SpecModel(model_params)
    assert len(model.free_params) == 5
    print(model)


Get a 'Source'
--------------

Now we need an object that will actually generate the galaxy spectrum using
stellar population synthesis.  For this we will use an object that wraps FSPS
allowing access to all the parameterized SFHs.  We will also just check which
spectral and isochrone libraries are being used.

.. code:: python

    from prospect.sources import CSPSpecBasis
    sps = CSPSpecBasis(zcontinuous=1)
    print(sps.ssp.libraries)

For piecewise constant and other flexible SFHs use `FastStepBasis` instead of
`CSPSpecBasis`.

Make a prediction
-----------------

We can now predict our data for any set of parameters.  This will take a little
time because fsps is building and caching the SSPs.  Subsequent calls to predict
will be faster.  Here we'll just make the prediction for the current value of
the free parameters.

.. code:: python

    current_parameters = ",".join([f"{p}={v}" for p, v in zip(model.free_params, model.theta)])
    print(current_parameters)
    (spec, phot), mfrac = model.predict(model.theta, observations, sps=sps)
    print("filter,observed,predicted")
    for i, f in enumerate(obs["filters"]):
        print(f"{f.name},{obs['maggies'][i]},{phot[i]}")


Run a fit
---------

Since we can make predictions and we have (photometric) data and uncertainties,
we should be able to construct a likelihood function, and then combine with the
priors to sample the posterior.  Here we'll use the pre-defined default
posterior probability function.  We also set some sampling related keywords to
make the fit go a little faster (but give rougher posterior estimates), though
it should still take of order tens of minutes.

.. code:: python

    from prospect.fitting import lnprobfn, fit_model

    # just the photometry
    obs = [observations[1]]

    # posterior probability of the initial parameters given the photometry
    lnp = lnprobfn(model.theta, model, observations=obs, sps=sps)

    # now do the posterior sampling
    fitting_kwargs = dict(nlive_init=400, nested_method="rwalk", nested_target_n_effective=10000, nested_dlogz_init=0.05)
    output = fit_model(obs, model, sps, lnprobfn=lnprobfn,
                       optimize=False, dynesty=True,
                       **fitting_kwargs)
    result = output["sampling"]

The ``result`` is a dictionary with keys giving the Monte Carlo samples of
parameter values and the corresponding posterior probabilities.  Because we are
using nested sampling, we also get weights associated with each parameter sample
in the chain.

Typically we'll want to save the fit information.  We can save the output of the
sampling along with other information about the model and the data that was fit
as follows:

.. code:: python

    from prospect.io import write_results as writer
    writer.write_hdf5("./quickstart_dynesty_mcmc.h5",
                      config=fitting_kwargs,
                      model=model,
                      obs=observations,
                      output["sampling"],
                      None,
                      sps=sps)

Note that this doesn't include all the config information that would normally be stored (see :ref:`usage`)


Make plots
----------

Now we'll want to read the saved fit information and make plots. To read the
information we can use the built-in reader.

.. code:: python

    from prospect.io import read_results as reader
    hfile = "./quickstart_dynesty_mcmc.h5"
    out, out_obs, out_model = reader.results_from(hfile)

This gives a dictionary of useful information (``out``), as well as the obs data
that we were using and, in some cases, a reconsitituted model object. However,
that is *only* possible if the model generation code is saved to the results file,
in the form of the text for a `build_model()` function.  Here we will use just
use the model object that we've already generated.

First, lets make a corner plot of the posterior. We'll mark the highest
probablity posterior sample as well.

.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
    from prospect.plotting import corner
    nsamples, ndim = out["chain"].shape
    cfig, axes = pl.subplots(ndim, ndim, figsize=(10,9))
    #axes = corner.allcorner(out["chain"].T, out["theta_labels"], axes, weights=out["weights"], color="royalblue", show_titles=True)

    from prospect.plotting.utils import best_sample
    pbest = best_sample(out)
    corner.scatter(pbest[:, None], axes, color="firebrick", marker="o")

Note that the highest probability sample may well be different than the peak of
the marginalized posterior distribution.

Now let's plot the observed SED and the spectrum and SED of the highest
probability posterior sample.

.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
    sfig, saxes = pl.subplots(2, 1, gridspec_kw=dict(height_ratios=[1, 4]), sharex=True)
    ax = saxes[1]
    pwave = np.array([f.wave_effective for f in out_obs["filters"]])
    # plot the data
    ax.plot(pwave, out_obs["maggies"], linestyle="", marker="o", color="k")
    ax.errorbar(pwave,  out_obs["maggies"], out_obs["maggies_unc"], linestyle="", color="k", zorder=10)
    ax.set_ylabel(r"$f_\nu$ (maggies)")
    ax.set_xlabel(r"$\lambda$ (AA)")
    ax.set_xlim(3e3, 1e4)
    ax.set_ylim(out_obs["maggies"].min() * 0.1, out_obs["maggies"].max() * 5)
    ax.set_yscale("log")

    # get the best-fit SED
    bsed = out["bestfit"]
    ax.plot(bsed["restframe_wavelengths"] * (1+out_obs["redshift"]), bsed["spectrum"], color="firebrick", label="MAP sample")
    ax.plot(pwave, bsed["photometry"], linestyle="", marker="s", markersize=10, mec="orange", mew=3, mfc="none")

    ax = saxes[0]
    chi = (out_obs["maggies"] - bsed["photometry"]) / out_obs["maggies_unc"]
    ax.plot(pwave, chi, linestyle="", marker="o", color="k")
    ax.axhline(0, color="k", linestyle=":")
    ax.set_ylim(-2, 2)
    ax.set_ylabel(r"$\chi_{\rm best}$")

Sometimes it is desirable to reconstitute the SED from a particular posterior
sample or set of samples, or even the spectrum of the highest probability sample
if it was not saved.  This requires both the model and the sps object generated
previously.

.. code:: python

    from prospect.plotting.utils import sample_posterior
    # Here we fairly and randomly choose a posterior sample
    p = sample_posterior(out["chain"], weights=out["weights"], nsample=1)
    # show this sample in the corner plot
    corner.scatter(p.T, axes, color="darkslateblue", marker="o")
    # regenerate the spectrum and plot it
    spec, phot, mfrac = model.predict(p[0], obs=out_obs, sps=sps)
    ax = saxes[1]
    ax.plot(sps.wavelengths * (1+out_obs["redshift"]), spec, color="darkslateblue", label="posterior sample")
